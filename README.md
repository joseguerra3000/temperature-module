Temperature Module
==================
Temperature module of small dimensions (approximately 45x25mm), compatible with arduino and digilent cerebot.
Useful for data acquisition systems based on microcontrollers (arduino, pic, etc.) and as a thermoresistor calibrator.
Able to use three sensors at the same time:
  - LM35
  - AD22103
  - thermoresistor

Functioning
===========
It needs to be powered with + 5V and + 3.3V to measure temperatures greater thad 0°C. 
Optionally it can also be supplied with -5V to measure temperatures below 0°C with the LM35 sensor.
It offers three independent analog outputs, one for each sensor.
